# 🦸‍♀️ Superhero Class Project

## 📚 Overview
This Python project demonstrates key principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using a custom `Superhero` class. It walks through class creation, method definition, object instantiation, and inheritance—culminating in a polymorphic and encapsulated design.

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Define the Base Class

We start by creating a `Superhero` class with core attributes:
- `name`: Real name of the hero
- `alias`: Superhero identity
- `power`: Special ability
- `city`: City they protect
- `_reputation`: Encapsulated attribute (starts at 50)

Methods include:
- `introduce()`: Prints a hero intro
- `use_power()`: Simulates using their power
- `boost_reputation(points)`: Increases reputation
- `get_reputation()`: Returns current reputation

---

## 🛠 Step 2: Add Attributes and Methods

We expand the class with:
- `weakness`: Adds vulnerability
- `energy`: Tracks stamina (starts at 100)

New methods:
- `recharge()`: Restores energy to full
- `reveal_weakness()`: Displays the hero’s weakness

What This Demonstrates
- Polymorphism: All objects share the same method name (move()), but each one behaves differently.
- Inheritance: All vehicle types inherit from the base Vehicle class.
- Clean structure: Easy to extend—just add more vehicle types with their own move() logic.

If you want to switch to animals next (like Dog, Bird, Fish) or add a speed attribute to each vehicle, I can help you level it up. You're coding like a champ!
