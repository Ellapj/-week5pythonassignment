What This Demonstrates
- Polymorphism: All objects share the same method name (move()), but each one behaves differently.
- Inheritance: All vehicle types inherit from the base Vehicle class.
- Clean structure: Easy to extendâ€”just add more vehicle types with their own move() logic.

If you want to switch to animals next (like Dog, Bird, Fish) or add a speed attribute to each vehicle, I can help you level it up. You're coding like a champ!
